## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository fro github `[https://github.com/caseycling/pytest-bdd-appium-demo.git`
2. Go to into the repository `cd pytest-bdd-appium-demo`

## Installation:

Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Create a virtual environment:

`python -m venv venv`

On Windows:
`venv\Scripts\activate`

On macOS/Linux:
`source venv/bin/activate`

## Install the required packages:

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

``` 
python_version==3.12
pytest
pytest-bdd
pytest-xdist
appium-python-client==4.1.0
selenium
```

Then, install the dependencies using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To install individual packages needed simply use:

`pip install pytest-xdist` or `pip install pytest`

## Intructions on setting up environment variables
If you have these saved as "environment variables" on your local machine, utilizing the logic in our project will work. If not, you can create a .env file and store them there also.

`$SAUCE_USERNAME`
`$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`

## Method 1: Setting Environment Variables Directly
On Windows:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables."
Select "Edit the system environment variables."
In the System Properties window, click "Environment Variables."
In the Environment Variables window, click "New" under "User variables" or "System variables."
Add the variable name (`SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`) and value.
Click OK to save and close all windows.

On macOS/Linux:
Open a terminal.

Edit your shell profile file (~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zshrc (i.e. vim .zshrc) depending on your shell).

Add the following lines:

```
export SAUCE_USERNAME="your_sauce_username"
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="your_sauce_access_key"
```
Save the file and run source ~/.bashrc (or the appropriate file) to apply the changes.


## Method 2: Using a .env File
Create a .env file:

In your project directory, create a file named .env.
Add the environment variables:

Open the .env file and add the following lines:

```
SAUCE_USERNAME=your_sauce_username
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=your_sauce_access_key
```
Load the .env file:

Install the python-dotenv package if it's not already installed:

`pip install python-dotenv`

In your Python code, load the environment variables at the start of your script or configuration file:
```
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

sauce_username = os.getenv('SAUCE_USERNAME')
sauce_access_key = os.getenv('SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY')
```
This method ensures that sensitive information is kept separate from your code and is easier to manage across different environments.

Tips:
Ensure your .env file is added to .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to version control.
Use environment variables to keep sensitive information secure and configurable without modifying your codebase.

## Running the Tests

You can start individual non parallel tests by using .ex `pipenv run pytest tests/mobile-web/test_add_item_to_cart.py`

or you can use the parallel [scripts] found in the Pipfile:

```
mobile-web = "pipenv run pytest -n5 tests/mobile-web"
native-app = "pipenv run pytest -n8 tests/native-app"
native-app-android = "pipenv run pytest tests/native-app/android"
native-app-iOs = "pipenv run pytest -n3 tests/native-app/iOS"
```
