# Project Overview
This is an example repo of mobile-web tests and native mobile app tests for Android and iOs using Python with pytest-BDD and Appium via a sauce labs account on [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) infrastructure through [SauceDemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/caseycling/pytest-bdd-appium-demo.git`
2. Go to into the repository `cd pytest-bdd-appium-demo`
3. `pipenv install`

## Installation:

Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Install the required packages:

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

``` 
python_version==3.12
pytest
pytest-bdd
pytest-xdist
appium-python-client==4.1.0
selenium
```

Then, install the dependencies using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To install individual packages instead of using .txt file, simply use:

`pip install pytest-xdist` or `pip install pytest` etc...

Verify the installation of packages (optional):

`pip list`


## Instructions on setting up environment variables
If you have these saved as "environment variables" on your local machine, utilizing the logic in our project will work. If not, you can create a .env file and store them there also.

# Directory Structure

- **`features/`**: Contains your BDD feature files, written in Gherkin syntax. These files define the behavior of the application in a more readable format.

- **`tests/`**:
  - **`mobile-web/`**: Includes test files specific to mobile web testing.
  - **`native-app/`**:
    - **`android/`**: Contains tests and step definitions specific to Android native apps.
    - **`iOS/`**: Contains tests and step definitions specific to iOS native apps.

### How `pytest-bdd` Runs in Parallel

1. **Feature Files**: Located in the `features/` directory, these files describe scenarios and steps that need to be tested.

2. **Step Definitions**: These are Python functions that implement the steps described in the feature files. They are usually placed in the corresponding test directories under `tests/`, such as `mobile-web/`, `native-app/android/`, and `native-app/iOS/`.

3. **Test Files**: These files include the test logic and use the step definitions to execute the scenarios. They are found in the same directories as step definitions or in a subdirectory as needed.

### Parallel Execution with `pytest-bdd`

- **Pytest-Xdist Integration**: `pytest-bdd` works with `pytest-xdist` to run tests in parallel. The `pytest-xdist` plugin distributes test execution across multiple CPUs or machines, improving performance for large test suites.

- **Running Tests**: When `pytest` is executed with the `-n` option (e.g., `pytest -n auto`), `pytest-xdist` automatically runs tests in parallel. It recognizes the test files and steps definitions across the `tests/` directories and handles parallel execution efficiently.

This structure ensures a clean separation between different types of tests and platforms while enabling parallel test execution to optimize testing efficiency.

# Running the Tests

You can start individual non parallel tests by using .ex `pipenv run pytest tests/mobile-web/test_add_item_to_cart.py`

or you can use the provided "parallel" [scripts] found in the Pipfile:

```
mobile-web = "pipenv run pytest -n5 tests/mobile-web"
native-app = "pipenv run pytest -n8 tests/native-app"
native-app-android = "pipenv run pytest tests/native-app/android"
native-app-iOs = "pipenv run pytest -n3 tests/native-app/iOS"
```
